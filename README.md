# Academic Intelligence AI

Academic Intelligence AI is an AI-powered product designed to continuously collect, process, and analyze academic and PMF-related news and documents, and provide structured, source-backed answers through semantic search and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

The system is built as an end-to-end data pipeline that ingests content from multiple sources (news websites, RSS feeds, PDFs), transforms raw data into validated, versioned knowledge chunks, and stores them in both relational and vector databases for efficient querying.

On top of the data layer, the product offers an AI-driven query interface that allows users to ask natural language questions and receive concise, confidence-scored answers grounded in the original sources.

## Key Capabilities

- Automated ingestion of academic and PMF-related content from web and document sources
- Robust ETL pipeline with validation, metadata extraction, and versioning
- Vector-based semantic search using embeddings
- RAG-based answer generation with source attribution
- Observability and monitoring for data quality, pipeline health, and content drift
- Modular, cloud-ready architecture designed for future scaling

## Intended Use

This project is built as a production-oriented AI product, not a research prototype.
It serves as a foundation for:

- Student-focused academic news intelligence
- PMF and research trend monitoring
- AI-assisted knowledge discovery over continuously changing data
